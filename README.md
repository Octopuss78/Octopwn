# Octopwn

This is a simple tool to retrieve interesting information on an ELF binary, such as sections address, Mitigations and interesting gadgets

For this first version, only Elf x64 and ELF x86 are supported but more architextures will be added on future commits.

Enjoy ;)

## Usage
Change BINARY to the path of your binary and ARCH to "amd64" or "i386".
